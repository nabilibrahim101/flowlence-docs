# Projects

Projects combine multiple sensors and concepts from the individual tutorials into complete, functional systems. Make sure you've gone through the relevant sensor tutorials before starting a project.

## Available Projects

| Project | Sensors Used | Difficulty |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| [Smart Lighting System](smart-lighting.md) | LED, LDR, Button | Beginner |
| [Alarm System](alarm-system.md) | PIR, Buzzer, LED | Beginner |
| [Weather Station](weather-station.md) | DHT11, LCD, LED | Intermediate |
| [Auto Plant Watering](auto-watering.md) | Soil Moisture, Relay, LCD | Intermediate |
| [IoT Dashboard](iot-dashboard.md) | DHT11, WiFi, ThingsBoard | Advanced |

## Project Structure

Each project includes:

1. **Overview** - What you'll build and why it's useful
2. **Components Needed** - List of sensors and modules
3. **Wiring Diagram** - Complete circuit with all components
4. **Step-by-Step Code** - Build the program block by block
5. **Testing** - How to verify everything works
6. **Extend It** - Ideas to make the project your own
